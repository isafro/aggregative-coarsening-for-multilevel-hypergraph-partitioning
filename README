==================

Notes on algorithms:

The paper describes two versions, inner-product coarsening and stable matching coarsening. By default, when run with PHG_COARSENING_METHOD=rs_alg_dist, the inner product coarsening is used. The code for stable matching is provided only for reproducibility purposes; stable matching based coarsening doesn't produce better results and is more computationally expensive (especially in this inefficient implementation). To use it, go to `packages/zoltan/src/phg/rs_amg_match.cpp` and uncomment `#define RS_STABLE_MATCHING`

===================

In general, the user is advised to refer to Trilinos documentation for troubleshooting any problems during installation: http://trilinos.org/about/documentation/
